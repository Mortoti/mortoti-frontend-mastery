# MORTOTI: Frontend Mastery

Project-driven mastery of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript fundamentals. This repository is designed to build the rock-solid frontend foundation required for high-level Django backend engineering.

## Objective
To transition from conceptual understanding to technical execution by building 16 functional web applications, focusing on DOM manipulation, asynchronous logic, and state management.

## The Django Bridge
Each project in this folder serves a specific purpose for future Django integration:
* **Forms/Validation:** Prepares for `Django Forms` and `CSRF` handling.
* **API Projects:** Prepares for `Django REST Framework (DRF)`.
* **Data Projects:** Prepares for `Django ORM` and Database Relationship mapping.



## Tech Stack
- **Structure:** HTML5 (Semantic)
- **Styling:** CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid/Variables)
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## Execution
The repository is organized into isolated project folders. Each folder contains its own `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

```bash
# To view a project
cd [project-folder-name]
